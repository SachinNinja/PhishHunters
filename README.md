#Introduction
Phishing attacks continue to pose a significant threat to online users. This web application aims to protect users from falling victim to phishing attempts by predicting the likelihood of a website being a phishing site using the Naive Bayes machine learning algorithm. The system is trained on a dataset of known phishing and legitimate websites to make accurate predictions.

#Features
Web-based interface for easy accessibility.
Phishing website classification using Naive Bayes ML algorithm.
User-friendly UI for inputting URLs and viewing results.
Quick and efficient phishing detection to enhance online security.
Reliable and accurate results based on the trained ML model.

#Installation
To run the Phish Hunter website locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/yourusername/phish-hunter.git
Navigate to the project directory: cd phish-hunter
Open index.html in your preferred web browser.
Usage
Open the Phish Hunter website in your web browser.
Enter the URL you want to check for phishing in the input field.
Click on the "Check" button.
The Naive Bayes algorithm will process the URL and display the prediction result on the screen.
Please note that the accuracy of the prediction depends on the quality of the trained ML model, which can be improved by training on larger and more diverse datasets.

#Technologies
The Phish Hunter website is built using the following technologies:

HTML5, CSS3 for the frontend user interface.
JavaScript for handling user interactions and making API calls.
Naive Bayes Machine Learning algorithm for phishing classification.
